**Version**: 1.0.13

## Overview
An application to allow Numerai users the ability to easily compare model performance. The application provides performance statistics for each model across live rounds, pending payouts, staked amounts, and mmc and correlation rankings for each model. In addition the application provides a total sum of all staked models, pending payouts across all models and total "live" staked amount which is the sum of all pending payouts with the sum of all staked amounts.

## User Instructions
To use this application, create a model collection by entering a name and adding your model names. Users can create multiple model collections and can add any number of models to each collection. Once a user has created a collection they are able to view the collection detail page which provides information on each model performance as well as collection performance. For security purposes all model collections are stored in local storage.
